        <h2>A brief description of the Country of Japan</h2>
        <p>
          Japan is an island nation located in East Asia, consisting of four
          main islands—Honshu, Hokkaido, Kyushu, and Shikoku—along with numerous
          smaller ones. Known for its rich cultural heritage, Japan seamlessly
          blends traditional practices with cutting-edge technology. The country
          is famous for its historic temples, serene gardens, and vibrant cities
          like Tokyo and Kyoto. Japanese cuisine, including sushi, ramen, and
          tempura, is celebrated worldwide. Japan's natural beauty, from Mount
          Fuji to its cherry blossoms, attracts many visitors. Additionally, it
          has a robust economy, being a leader in technology and automotive
          industries, while also facing unique challenges such as an aging
          population and natural disasters.
